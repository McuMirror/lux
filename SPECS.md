Lux Tech-Specs
==============

Lux refers to a protocol stack which is designed to control many lightweight nodes. 

It supports the transmission of power and data from a host device to one or more nodes over a simple serial link. This mode is capable of data rates approaching 3 megabits per second and supplying 30 Watts of power over distances of up to 100 feet. It is designed to be easy to implement and uses low-cost cabling and connectors.

Additionally, it also supports transmitting data over UDP (e.g. with IP & Ethernet). This mode makes it easy to abstract the controller from the physical hardware.

### Stack Comparison

The *Serial/Hardware* stack is:

1. Serial Physical Layer (48V; RS-485; 3Mbps)
2. Data Link Layer (COBS; CRC)
3. MAC Layer (Speak-when-spoken-to)
4. Application Layer

The *Network/IP* stack is:

1. Physical Layer (Unspecified; e.g. Ethernet)
2. Data Link Layer (Unspecified; e.g. IPv4)
3. Transport Layer (UDP)
3. Data Link Layer (COBS; CRC)
3. MAC Layer (Speak-when-spoken-to)
4. Application Layer

Serial Physical Layer
---------------------

Lux is designed with a hub-and-spoke model in mind. Each lux universe must have exactly one master but may have an arbitrary number of nodes (limited only by the bandwidth of the bus.)

The master exposes one or more RJ-11 jacks (6p4c) and each node exposes one RJ-11 jack. Devices are connected with straight-through RJ-11 cables no longer than 100 feet and no thinner than 26 AWG per conductor.

The lux pinout is as follows:
 1. GND
 2. A
 3. B
 4. PWR

The voltage that nodes see between PWR and GND is nominally 48 volts, but may be as high as 54 volts or as low as 42 volts. The master or hub provides this power, and nodes consume it. The master should not output less than 48 volts or more than 54 volts. The drop in the cabling may be as large as 6 volts.

Nodes may be bus-powered or self-powered. A bus-powered node must not draw more than 650 mA from the bus. A self-powered node must use GND as reference for the data signals (i.e. must not be floating or at a different potential from the bus.)

RS-485 is used for the data lines. Nodes and masters should implement the recommended bias resistors and a termination resistor of 120 ohms, as well as a RS-485 compatible tranceiver capable of 3 megabit per second communcation. The serial protocol uses 3 megabaud, 8 data bits, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity. The serial link is half-duplex.

Network Transport Layer
-----------------------

Lux uses UDP for sending data over the Internet/LAN. Lux does not specify which protocols must be used below UDP, but usualy it is IPv4 or IPv6.

Common Layers
-------------
### Data Link Layer
Lux packets are encoded using consistent-overhead byte stuffing (COBS). A NULL (out-of-band 0 byte) is placed at the end of a packet. A packet consists of three parts:

<table><tr>
 <td>Destination Address <br> (4&nbsp;bytes)</td>
 <td>Command <br> (1&nbsp;byte)</td>
 <td>Index <br> (1&nbsp;byte)</td>
 <td width="100%">Payload <br> (0-1024&nbsp;bytes) </td>
 <td>CRC <br> (4&nbsp;bytes) </td>
</tr></table>

The destination address is four bytes. Nodes may have one or more addresses. One address may be used by multiple nodes (useful for multicast.) Because lux uses hubs, all traffic generated by the host will reach every node. Nodes should filter packets based on the address, and discard any packets not addressed to them. For the rest of this document, the address is assumed to be little-endian.

The *command* and *index* fields are one byte each. They are used by the application layer.

The payload can be between 0 and 1024 bytes long, inclusive (after COBS decoding.) The data contained in the payload is not specified by lux, except by way of the defacto standards described below. Packets with payloads longer than 1024 bytes should be discarded as corrupt.

After the payload comes a 32-bit CRC of the entire packet (after COBS decoding.) If the CRC does not check out, the packet should be discarded as corrupt.

Payload length is never explicitly stated. Instead, packets are null-teriminated. Payload length is defined as the packet length minus 8 bytes, to account for the address and checksum.

Packets shorter than 8 bytes should be discarded, though not necessarily marked as corrupt. An optional feature of this protocol is to start (as well as end) packets with a null. When this happens, the decoder may interpret the data between packets as packets. On an ideal busimplementing this two-zero variant, these packets are of length 0 and do not indicate an error condition.

### MAC Layer

Lux uses a speak-when-spoken-to access control scheme. The master sends packets out to the nodes, and may optionally expect a response. If the master expects a response and does not receive one, it may re-send the packet after a timeout mutually agreed upon in advance by the node and the master. Nodes can only send data back to the master. Node should never spuriously send packets, as they may collide with packets originating from the master.

Due to the topology of the bus, packets originating from nodes will not necessarily reach other nodes. Nodes that are sending packets to the master should clear the destination field (set it to all zeros.) Nodes should never react to packets with this address.

### Application Layer

Each packet sent to a node is a *command*. Commands should be as idempotent/stateless as possible.

The command byte (octet 5) indicates the command type. `0x00` through `0x1F` are reserved for commands common to all lux devices, `0x20` through `0xFF` are device-specific. Example commands inclue ``GET_ID``, ``RESET``, ``GET_ADDR``, ``SET_ADDR``, ``GET_PKTCNT``, ``RESET_PKTCNT``, etc. 

<!-- Some command IDs are common to all lux nodes, others are specific to particular node types. For example, ``FRAME`` is specific to LED strips. -->



#### Responses

In keeping with the MAC, nodes can only transmit responses -- they cannot "push" data. Some commands are *send-recieve*, and are defined to require a response. Others like ``RESET`` are *send-only* do not have a response. It is a violiation of the MAC to respond to send-only command, or to respond with zero or multiple packets to a send-recieve command.

In a response, the destination is set to `0x00000000`, and the `command` and `index` fields are copied from the request packet.

A commmon response is a simple *ACK* containing no other data. In this case, the first byte of the payload is set to `0x00`, optionally followed by the CRC from the request packet.

#### Command Descriptions

Name            | # Resp.   | Payload           | Description 
----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------
`RESET`         | 0         | None              | Reboot/reset the node
`RESET_BL`      | 0         | None | *(Optional)* Reset & boot into bootloader mode
`GET_ID`        | 1         | None | Equivalent to a zero-length packet. Respond with string containing node name.
`GET_ADDR`      | 1         | None | 
`SET_ADDR`      | 1 (ACK)   | | 
`WRITE_CONFIG`  | 1         | | Flush configuration changes to nonvolatile storage
`GET_PKTCNT`    | 1         | None |
`RESET_PKTCNT`  | 1 (ACK)   | |
`GET_USERDATA`  | 1         | None |
`SET_USERDATA`  | 1 (ACK)   | | 


De-facto standards
------------------

The following are not mandatory for implementing a correctly-functioning lux node. However, they are highly recommended to maintain compatibility between nodes.

Nodes should always accept packets on address 0xFFFFFFFF. That way, a node with an unknown or corrupt address filter can always be reached.

Uninitialized nodes should assume address 0x80000000. That way, the master can "enumerate" new nodes by continuously sending zero-length packets to 0x80000000. When an unitialized node is found, it should be configured with a permanent address and stop listening on 0x80000000.
